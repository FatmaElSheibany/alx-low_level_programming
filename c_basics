save source code with .c extension e.g. hello.c
compile using gcc hello.c
this will create an executable file with some name e.g. a.out
or you can name the executable file while compiling by running
gcc hello.c -o hello
this way the executable file will be named hello
another alternative (for linux os and the like, probably won't work for windows) is 
make hello
the terminal will then look for a source code file with a similar name and 
compile it into an executable file named hello

char are enclosed in ' '
str in " "

what a compiler does: preprocessing --> compiling --> assembling --> linking

preprocessing: 
**removes comments from source code
**it grabs the required header files and 'opens' them into the source code
**replaces any macro names with their values/codes

compiling: takes the result of preprocessing and generates an assembly code out of it
**the assembly code is still not understandable by the machine so it has to be processed to binary code

assembling: process the assembly code into binary code also known as object code

linking: there's static linking and dynamic linking
this combines different object files generated from different modules into a single executable code
you'd have different modules if for example you were working on a single project as a team so you 
generate >1 source codes therefore having >1 object/binary codes but you only need 1 executable file 
at the end. that's one of the jobs a linker does. 
i need to read more on this linking part.
